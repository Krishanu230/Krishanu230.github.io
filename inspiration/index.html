    <font color="#FFFF00" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" size="4">it is after a bad day at gym that i am have come to face some thoughts  that are telling me that they need this inspiration series. I have been avoiding them for a while and they are not happy about it. They are demanding the same rights as the other resident thoughts of my brain as if it a fucking democracy. <br> So here goes the first entry.
        <br> I think I should think about writing seriously. Thinking about thinking gets really weird and should be practised with caution. You run the risk of uplifting the veil of "human" and just for a horrific moment you feel so like a biological calculating machinery that your are. You were supposed to fly to the higer levels of abstractions of thinking, feel about feels etc not dig deep in your architectural layers and think about thinking.</font>
